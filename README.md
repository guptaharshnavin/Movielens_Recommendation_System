# Movielens Recommendation System - Capstone Project

For this project, we make use of the **Movielens 10M Dataset**. The Movielens datasets were collected by the *GroupLens Research Project* at the *University of Minnesota*.  

In this project, we make a *Recommendation System*, which recommends movies to watch to the users, based on the various features that are present in the dataset, which are the features that are present in the ratings given by other users.  

The **Movielens 10M Dataset** consists of the follows features :  
1. **Movie ID** : It is an unique numeric value assigned to every movie, that has been rated and is available in the dataset.  
2. **User ID** : It is an unique numeric value assigned to every user, who has rated atleast one or more movies.  
3. **Title** : This is a character field, which stores the title of the movie.  
4. **Genre** : This is a character field, which stores the genre of the movie.  
5. **Timestamp** : This field stores the timestamp, for the time when the rating was given. It is a numeric value, which the stores the time in reference to *January 1,1970*.
